# Interaction and deployment fift scripts
Set decimals and initial token holders in `setup.fif` and then run `new-token.fif` script to deploy a token contract.

Use `token.fif` to create an internal message body with request of transfering some tokens. You can send the request by `wallet.fif` standart script, indicating the body with `-B` flag.
